I finished reading chapter 1, but struggled with the logarithm calculations.
Those are a subject I never really understood in school. (Maybe I should repeat
that topic before diving deeper into algorithms.)

I solved the problem at the end of the chapter with a Python script: the tool I
reach to intuitively when it comes to computations. However, this is actually a
nice programming exercises to be done in the programming languages I'd actually
like to use for this project. (I implemented an approximative, computational
solution.) This would be a good exercise before starting with the actual
algorithms in chapter 2.

Being back home after my holidays, I finally picked up _Introduction to
Algorithms_ (4th Edition) from my bookshelf and filled the gaping void with some
other books I don't plan to read in the near future.

I started reading the book and answered the first couple of exercises.
