- Initialization: The sum of an empty array is 0.
- Maintenance: With every iteration, the sum is increased by the value of the
  current array element.
- Termination: The loop terminates once all elements have been processed.

    insertion-sort-descending(A, n):
        for i = 2 to n
            key = A[i]
            j = i - 1
            while j > 0 and A[j] < key // notice: < instead of >
                A[j + 1] = A[j]
                j = j - 1
            A[j + 1] = key

            if A[i] == x
                return i
        return nil

- Initialization: The search starts with the first element.
- Maintenance: If the current element is the element looked for, it is returned.
- Termination: Either the element found is returned, or `nil` if it hasn't been
  found.

Example:

    +  111011 (B)
    = 0000000 (C) 

    i = 1, e = 1
    = 0000001

    i = 2, e = 2
    = 0000101

    i = 3, e = 1
    = 0000101

    i = 4, e = 2
    = 0010101

    i = 5, e = 3
    = 0110101

    i = 6, e = 3
    = 1110101

       111010 (A = 58)
    +  111011 (B = 59)
    = 1110101 (C = 117)
