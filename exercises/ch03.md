If the biggest element starts at position `0`, it has to be moved `n-1` times.
On average, an element in a sequence sorted in reverse, needs to be moved
`(n-1)/2` times; which happens for `n` elements:

    n*(n-1)/2 = (n²-n)/2 => O(n²)

# 3.1-2

The smallest element of an array of size `n` is selected `n` times, which
requires `n` steps for the first time, and `1` step for the last time, i.e. on
average `(n+1)/2` steps taken `n` times:

    n*(n+1)/2 = (n²+n)/2 => O(n²)

# 3.1-3

`n*1/α` needs to be a natural number.

    f(α) = αn*(1-2α)n
         = (αn-2α²n)n
         = αn²-2α²n²

Derivative (in respect to α):

    n²-4αn²
    n²(1-4α)

Max. value where derivative equals 0:

    n²(1-4α)=0 => 4α=1 => α=1/4
