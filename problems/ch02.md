## a

- `n/k` sublists of length `k`
- worst case: `Θ(n²)`
- per sublist: `Θ(k²)` (worst case)
- for `n/k` sublists: `Θ(n/k * k²) = Θ(nk)` q.e.d.

## b

- `n` sublists of size `1`
- `n/k` sublists of size `k`
- `n` elements -> `n` sublists of size `1`
- depth of the tree: `lg(n)+1`, i.e. every element is merged in `lg(n)` times
- `n/k` sublists -> `n` elements, each merged only `lg(n/k)` times (shallower tree)

## c

TODO

## d

Run both Insertion Sort and Merge Sort for inputs of size `n=1..` to figure out
at which point Merge Sort becomes faster than insertion sort. Then use this `n`
as the length for sublists.

# 2-2

## a

`A'` must also contain all the elements of `A`.

## b

The inner loop moves the smallest element of the subsequence `A[i+1:n]` to the
position `A[i]`.

- Initialization: The loop always starts at the rightmost element `n`.
- Maintenance: In every step, the smaller element of the adjacent pair is moved
  one step to the left.
- Termination: The loop ends, once the smallest element of the subsequence
  `A[i+1:n]` has been moved to position `A[i]`.

## c

The outer loop starts with an unsorted array and turns it into a sorted array by
starting at the leftmost position, increasing the size of the sorted part in
every iteration, thereby decreasing the size of the unsorted part.

- Initialization: The loop starts at the first element.
- Maintenance: Since the inner loop moves the smallest element of the
  subsequence `A[i+1:n]` to position `A[i]`, the subsequence `A[1:i]` is sorted
  after every iteration of the outer loop.
- Termination: The outer loop ends when the `n-1` smallest elements of `A` have
  been moved into the sorted part, thus only leaving the biggest element at
  position `n`.

## d

The outer loop is performed `n-1` times, i.e. `Θ(n)`. The inner loop, started
`n-1` times, performes `n-i+1` iterations; i.e. `(n-1)/2` times on average,
which is `Θ(n)` again. Thus, Bubble Sort runs in `Θ(n²)` (worst time, best
time).
